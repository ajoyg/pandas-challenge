Module 4 challenge in the Data Analytics &amp;Vizualization Bootcamp. The Jupyter notebook PyCitySchools.ipynb in the PyCitySchools folder analyzes the standardized test data in the Resources folder for 15 high school in a district.

# Summary
 * Overall, there are 15 schools in the district with 39,170 students, the passing percentage of math and reading is 65%. The district has a total budget of $24.65M.

* As a whole, schools with higher budgets, did not yield better test results. The average math score in schools with higher spending ($645 - $675 per student) was 63.16%, which is 40.63% lower than schools with smaller budgets ($585 per student) that had an average math score of 93.46%.

* Charter schools out-perform public schools across all metrics. The largest difference is in the overall passing percentage for math and reading. The overall passing percentage for charter schools (90.4%) is 68.4% higher than public schools (53.67%).

* As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

# Additional details
* Charter schools have lesser students as compared to public schools. The largest public school Bailey High School (4976 students) has more than 10 times the students of the smallest charter school - Holden High School (472 students).

* Cabrera High School had the highest overal passing percentage in math and reading (91.33%) with one of the lowest per student budget ($582), while Rodriguez High School had the lowest overall passing percentage (52.98%) and it has one of the highest per student budget ($637).

* Rodriduez High School (3999 students) has more than 2 times the students as compared to Cabrera High School (1858), however, we don't have the information on class sizes for these schools. It will be useful to get the class size data to identify if there is a relationship between class size and grade outcome.
